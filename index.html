		            <p>After highschool, I'd like to go to college. The college I am interested in is City College of San Francisco! The reason why I picked this college is because CCSF is very close to my house. Makes commutes much much easier, take my core classes to get it over with then after that transfer to SF State to take the classes I want to major in. Plus the first two years of CCSF is free!

A 2015 Subaru WRX in Ice Metallic Silver. I plan to create an sleeper or an maxed out WRX. Performance parts and a few exterior parts will do. Anti lag sounds nice.

		            <p>According to my "Hobbies" and "What I Love" on my about me section, I really love to code. coding is a powerful thing especially because of now security issues in the technology field is getting into deep stuff. Lots of people try to crack, hack, and exploit lots of products of big companies. Well, the company i would love to work at is GoPro, Apple, Razer Inc., and possibly Subaru.

		            <p>As everyone knows. Everyone loves money no matter what you say, you will always love money. money can buy you everything. Sometimes happiness but for sure cannot buy love. Love is something special. I wanna make lots of money for my family and Icey so I can put alot of things on her. I'll plan to pay off my parents bills when I get up there.

                   Once you finish college and get a job, start to work hard and be hoenst to your work. This is the best policy for you. Work hard so you can keep us very happy so that you can make honest money and fulfill all your dreams with performance parts to Icey. Don't forget to take your family on a vacation once a year so that your family can be strong and have a good bond. Never skip work and go to church because God is the key to success.

                  Mat, this is pretty cool that you do this kind of stuff, I'm impressed that you have a car when me a junior still gets rides from his parnets lol still I think you should always try to be honest in this line of work but whatever makes you happy I guess. You do you and your car.
